# SimpleStorage Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat 
yarn hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli

```
